# Employee-Tracker

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to make a employee tracking data base that gave me a chance to practice what I have learned with SQL, but to also make a working product.
This employee tracker would be helpful to any company wanting to keep track of their employees, their roles, and their salaries.
I learned how to build a data base from scratch to make a helpful tool.
